Note : ignore the > when copying the command.

The .git\objects folder contains the files. The folder names start with the first 2 letters of SHA and inside contians the remaining SHA in the file name

# Structure of Project

|specifications\Readme.txt| a file to describe how to organize the files inside specification folder|
|specifications\\*| each laptop has a file here to describe its specs|
